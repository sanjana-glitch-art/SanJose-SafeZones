# SanJose-SafeZones
Police Calls Data Engineering, Analytics & Interactive Dashboard

# OVERVIEW
San José Safe Zones is an end-to-end data engineering and analytics project that transforms raw San José Police Calls for Service (2025) data into a fully cleaned, normalized, and query-optimized relational database. It then applies advanced SQL analytics to identify safer residential zones, detect incident hotspots, and uncover temporal and spatial patterns in police activity. An interactive Streamlit dashboard brings these insights to life with dynamic visualizations powered by Plotly.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
  - Design a normalized relational schema (3NF + Star Schema) for large‑scale police call data
  - Clean and standardize inconsistent date-time formats, null values, and text fields
  - Build fact and dimension tables for analytical querying
  - Implement advanced SQL analytics using window functions, CTEs, recursive queries, and indexing
  - Develop an interactive dashboard for real‑time exploration of safety patterns
